JumpScale Core Docs
===================

JumpScale is a branch from what used to be Pylabs. About 5 years ago
Pylabs was the basis of a cloud automation product which was acquired by
SUN Microsystems from a company called Q-Layer. In the mean time we are
3 versions further and we rebranded to JumpScale. Please visit
www.jumpscale.org & www.jumpscale.com for more information about our
products.
